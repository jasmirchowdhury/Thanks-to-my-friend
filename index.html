        Hello my friend this is a thank you website for you
    </h1>
    <p>Your patience and encouragement were incredible. You took time out of your busy schedule to explain concepts I struggled with, help me practice, and motivate me when I felt overwhelmed. You not only shared your knowledge but also believed in me, which gave me the confidence I needed to face my exams. I’m so grateful to have a friend as thoughtful and selfless as you.

        Aunty, I cannot thank you enough for your care and hospitality during this time. You made me feel so welcome and comfortable, ensuring that I had the right environment to focus on my studies. Your delicious meals and warm encouragement gave me the energy and positivity to keep going. I truly appreciate the extra effort you put in to make everything easier for me.
        
        Both of you have shown me the true meaning of kindness and support, and I will always remember how you stood by me when I needed help the most. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done. I feel so lucky to have such amazing people in my life.
    
    
    Thank you Oishorjo
    and Aunty
